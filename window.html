    <p>
        RAIN DETECTION WITH AUTOMATIC WINDOWS Built a system that automatically closes windows
when it rains using an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The key components are the Arduino, a rain sensor, and a servo
motor.The rain sensor detects rain by measuring changes in conductivity when wet. It sends a signal to the Arduino.
The Arduino then controls the servo motor based on the program. The program is set to close the window when rain
is detected and open it again when it stops raining.
