    <h1>Solar Wireless Electrical Vehicle Charging System</h1>
    <p>
        Built an Electrical Vehicle (EV) which is the most suitable alternative to petroleum vehicles. Its total dependency on non-renewable sources of electricity, the expensive price of charging, and the socket plug-in or out problem during charging are major issues of EVs. The Solar Wireless Electrical Vehicle Charging System helps in reducing the dependency of electricity for recharging or even allowing the EV to be charged where electricity is not present.
